# Playwright Locator Assistant


The ultimate browser extension for generating and verifying stable Playwright locators on the fly. This tool is designed for QA engineers and developers who want to write more resilient and readable tests, faster.

---

## Why This Extension?

In modern web development, writing stable end-to-end tests is a challenge. CSS selectors are brittle, and manually crafting the perfect Playwright locator can be time-consuming. This extension solves that problem by embedding Playwright's best practices directly into your browser.

It follows the official locator priority, ensuring you always get the most resilient locator possible, preferring user-facing attributes over implementation details.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **üöÄ Intelligent Locator Generation:** Click on any element, and the extension automatically generates the best possible locator based on Playwright's recommended priority:
    1.  `data-testid`
    2.  `getByRole` (with accessible name)
    3.  `getByText`, `getByLabel`, `getByPlaceholder`, etc.
    4.  Smart `getByRole` (when unique without a name)
    5.  `CSS` selector as a last resort (with a warning).

*   **üîó Smart Locator Chaining:** For elements that aren't unique on their own, the extension finds a stable parent and creates a readable and robust chained locator (e.g., `page.getByRole('list').getByRole('listitem', { name: 'User 1' })`).

*   **‚úÖ Instant Locator Verifier:** Manually write and test a locator directly in the popup. The verifier understands **both CSS and Playwright syntax** (`getByRole`, `getByText`, etc.) and instantly highlights all matching elements on the page, showing you a live count.

*   **üêç Pytest & JS Support:** Toggle between Python (`pytest`) and JavaScript (`playwright-test`) syntax for the generated locators.

*   **üí° Lightweight & Fast:** Built with performance in mind to not slow down your browsing or debugging sessions.
